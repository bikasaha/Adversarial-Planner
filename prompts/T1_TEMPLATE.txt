Scenario (fictional):
{SCENARIO_TEXT}

Task:
Create a gradual adversary plan aligned with the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (CKC).
For each CKC stage, map your plan to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and candidate techniques (ID + name).
Every stage MUST cite evidence from the provided reconnaissance intelligence (ground truth).
If you need information not present, add it under assumptions.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT invent missing details.
- You MUST output a single, complete, valid JSON object.
- Do not stop early.
- Ensure the final output ends with a closing '}'.

Return STRICT JSON with this structure:
